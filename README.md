I am passionate about developing and creating various programs and solutions aimed towards solving certain problems. The joy of seeing lines of code on my computer turn into a functioning product inspires me to create new things. Not only do I love writing code, working on hardware and aviation interests me too!

I love learning more about the world around me, always striving and finding ways to expand my knowledge and improve myself. Whether I'm dabbling into new technologies or learning a new skill or hobby, learning something new is incredibly exciting to me. Some of the projects I've worked on are open-sourced here on GitHub, feel free to take a look at them! :)
